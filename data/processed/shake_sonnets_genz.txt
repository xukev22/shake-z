Sonnet 1
Yo, hottest people gotta keep the genes flowing,
So beauty's flower never stops glowing.
But you out here only staring at yourself,
You're hoarding vibes, keeping love on a shelf.
Bro, you're the freshest flex around,
Spring's influencer, drip so profound.
Yet you're selfish, hiding your shine,
Quit gatekeeping looks, it's borderline crime.
Have some mercy, don't be greedy, dude—
The world deserves your glow too.

Sonnet 2
When you're older, wrinkles gonna hit you tough,
That glow-up won't stay; beauty fades, that's rough.
When asked, "Where'd your looks go?" what'll you say?
"In my sunken selfies," nah, that's just cringe, ay.
But if you say, "Here's my kid, they got my glow,"
That flex eternal—now that's a W, bro.

Sonnet 3
Check the mirror—see that face?
It’s prime time to pass on your grace.
If you don’t, you're lowkey robbing the earth,
Stealing someone's chance to flex that birth.
You reflect your mom’s OG glow,
Keep the cycle going, don’t end the show.
If you stay solo and ghost this game,
Your fire dies with you—that’s just lame.

Sonnet 4
Yo, stop wasting that pretty privilege,
Nature loans you looks, don’t be stingy with it.
You’re sitting on your shine, stacking no clout,
When you dip from life, what’s your legacy about?
Unused beauty hits the grave with you, bro,
Used right, your drip stays forever, you know.

Sonnet 5
Time hustles nonstop, turning summer cold,
Flowers droop, beauty’s drip gets old.
But preserved in memories, beauty's still sweet—
Even winter can't kill that vibe completely.

Sonnet 6
Don’t let age kill your prime time, fam,
Bottle your glow, keep beauty on cam.
Having kids ain't a debt, it's investing smart,
Clone your vibe, secure your clout’s part.
Multiply your drip, you’ll beat the clock,
Your legacy's lit, immortality unlocked.

Sonnet 7
Like sunrise catching eyes, young glow slays,
But sunset fades, eyes turn away.
Same with you, when past your peak,
If no kid continues, your hype gets weak.
Level up quick, or your clout’s deceased,
Keep that line going—vibes increased.

Sonnet 8
Why sad vibes when the music hits?
Joy stacks with joy—life legit.
If melodies clash, it’s 'cause you’re solo,
Family's harmony hits better, no FOMO.
Kids and parents form that beat,
Stay single forever? Nah, incomplete.

Sonnet 9
Staying single ’cause you're scared of hurting hearts?
Nah, if you die alone, whole world sobs in parts.
Leave your mark, let someone rep your style,
Otherwise, your drip fades after a while.
No self-love's worth your legacy’s doom,
That's mad sus—don’t leave beauty entombed.

Sonnet 10
If you love nobody, that's straight-up cold,
Seems like you're beefing with your own soul.
Fix that energy, spread some love around,
Clone your vibe, let your beauty rebound.
You hating yourself—that ain’t it, chief,
Make another you, that's mad relief.

Sonnet 11
Each day older, pass on your glow,
Your kid keeps you fresh, new drip on show.
Without renewal, life's straight-up dead,
Future cancelled, humanity unfed.
Nature flexed hard crafting your look,
Duplicate your swag, rewrite the book.

Sonnet 12
Watching clocks tick, daylight slip,
Beauty fades quick, life loses grip.
Leaves fall off, curls turn grey,
Nothing stays fresh; that's life's way.
Only way to beat time's blade—
Have a kid; that's a cheat code played.

Sonnet 13
Wish you'd stay forever, but you won't, that's fact,
Pass your glow down, legacy intact.
Don't let your house crumble, vibes decay,
Keep that drip strong, forever in play.
Don’t waste potential—remember your pops,
Let your kid say the same when your vibe drops.

Sonnet 14
Not astrology, but your eyes I read,
They say beauty and truth plant a seed.
If you don’t share your swag, real talk:
Truth and beauty vanish when you walk.

Sonnet 15
Everything peaks quick, nothing stays fire,
Even stars judge from skies higher.
Youth’s a short flex; beauty’s time short,
So I battle time, vibes to import.
I keep you fresh in verse forever new,
While age tries to snatch away from you.

Sonnet 16
Why fight time with weak rhymes, fam?
Beat decay by having kids, that's the jam.
Poetry ain't enough—birth your heir,
Your drip continues with kids out there.
Give yourself away, keeps you alive,
In offspring, your glow will thrive.

Sonnet 17
Future’s not gonna buy my hype,
Even though your beauty’s unmatched type.
My words? Just paper; your vibe’s too fire,
They'll think I lied, hype gone haywire.
Only kids can truly keep your clout alive,
Then you flex twice, kids and rhymes combined.

Sonnet 18
Compare you to summer? Nah, you glow brighter,
Summer's fleeting, your drip’s way tighter.
Rough days fade beauty, weather turns shady,
But your vibe lives on, verse always wavy.
So long as people live, and eyes can see,
This poem lives, keeping you eternally.

Sonnet 19
Yo, Time’s savage—destroys what’s wild,
But leave my bae alone, he's beauty-styled.
Wreck anything else, fine, do your worst,
But my love’s legacy’s in my verse.
You can’t fade this drip, that’s a fact,
Forever young, vibe always intact.

Sonnet 20
Nature crafted you, beauty's top tier,
Eyes steal hearts, gender unclear.
First designed a queen, but plot twist came,
Now you're my bae, my love the aim.
Ladies get your looks; I keep your heart—
That’s the deal; nature played her part.

Sonnet 21
Not flexing fake comparisons,
Your vibe's real—zero embarrassment.
Haters hype, cap so hard,
But your drip’s legit, my trump card.
Truth-only simping, no fake clout chase,
You're fire enough—no need to replace.

Sonnet 22
We age in sync; you young, me young,
Life’s playlist—our song’s unsung.
But watch your heart, protect your flame,
You hurt, I hurt—feels the same.
Your beauty vibes inside me tight,
Keep it chill, keep love in sight.

Sonnet 23
Stage fright hits when feelings speak,
Love words choke, knees go weak.
Let my eyes DM what I can't say,
My heart emojis you all day.

Sonnet 24
My eyes screenshot your perfect look,
Your face is stored in my heart's book.
Eyes snap pics, but can't catch vibes—
They see looks, but miss insides.

Sonnet 25
Fame fades fast; flex comes and goes,
Likes drop quick, clout quickly slows.
But loving you? That’s evergreen—
Steady hype, drama unseen.

Sonnet 26
These humble bars are yours alone,
Lowkey hype—I keep it toned.
Respect so big, my lines stay chill,
Secretly simping, loyal still.

Sonnet 27
Tired AF, night hits deep,
Body wants sleep, brain won't keep.
Thinking of you—no snooze tonight,
Your face, my vibe, insomnia fight.

Sonnet 28
Days stress hard, nights the same,
24/7 grind, missing you insane.
Day or night, can't catch peace,
You in my mind; feels won't cease.

Sonnet 29
Life gets trash; I'm canceled, low,
Feeling rejected, nothing to show.
Then I think of you—vibes restored,
From zero to hero, mood back on board.

Sonnet 30
Late-night feels, stuck in my head,
Thinking old beef, things unsaid.
Then thoughts of you erase regret,
Sadness gone, no time for fret.

Sonnet 31
You're every good thing that I've lost,
My losses paid, you're worth the cost.
All friends I've missed, regrets stacked high,
Come back alive when you're nearby.

Sonnet 32
When I'm ghosted, remember this rhyme,
My lines outdated, faded by time.
But read me kindly, ignore weak bars,
My love outshines these rhyme scars.

Sonnet 33
Morning sun flexed on mountain peaks,
Clouds rolled up—shade threw leaks.
Beauty's brief; perfection fades quick,
Your glow hid too, life's slick trick.

Sonnet 34
Why ghost me, sunshine? Cloudy moves,
Your sudden shade, vibes confused.
You regret the storm; apology sent,
Tears like rain, forgiveness spent.

Sonnet 35
Don't beat yourself up for that shade,
We all slip up; mistakes get made.
Your faults make beauty twice as fire,
Forgiving you's my main desire.

Sonnet 36
We gotta split vibes, love on low,
Separate clout—no public show.
Keep our feels private, hidden moves,
Distance sucks, but respect approves.

Sonnet 37
You're winning at life, makes me proud,
Your W's mine—hype allowed.
Your drip boosts me, vibes transferred,
My feels glow-up, though silent, heard.

Sonnet 38
How could my rhymes lack any clout,
When you're my muse, best bars come out.
Poems are fire, thanks to you,
My creativity unlocked—true.

Sonnet 39
Apart, but vibes still connect,
Distance, space—I still reflect.
You're half my soul, my best side,
Absence felt deep, can't hide.

Sonnet 40
Take all my love—fine, you win,
Even betrayal’s forgiven within.
Love you still, faults ignored,
Can't stay mad; feelings restored.

Sonnet 41
Maybe you flexed and caught some eyes,
Made me jealous, made me sigh.
But you're young; temptation's strong,
Love forgives—right or wrong.

Sonnet 42
Losing you hurts, betrayal rough,
But losing twice—double tough.
Still, your choices can't break ties,
I love you both, no compromise.

Sonnet 43
Eyes shut tight; it's you I see,
Darkness bright—you vibe with me.
Day and night, your image clear,
You're my vision, far or near.

Sonnet 44
If my heart could teleport straight,
I'd skip distance, end this wait.
Instead, I'm stuck, missing you deep,
Miles between—mood can't sleep.

Sonnet 45
My heart and mind rush quick to you,
Thoughts like texts sent right through.
Then silence hits, they're stuck away,
Waiting till you reply, someday.

Sonnet 46
Eyes and heart beef for your love,
Eyes want sight; heart needs dove.
Settle peace, let eyes your looks keep,
Heart gets your love, vibes run deep.

Sonnet 47
Eyes and heart now tight team,
Eyes snap pics, heart keeps dreams.
My heart loves what eyes have seen,
Eyes adore what heart feels keen.

Sonnet 48
Careful vibes locked up tight,
But thieves still lurk, sneaking right.
Can't lock love; worries run wild,
Losing you—biggest fear compiled.

Sonnet 49
If you ever dip and leave my side,
Judging vibes and fading pride,
Remember this: your truth won't fade,
Even if love gets betrayed.

Sonnet 50
Heavy heart, long journey ahead,
Leaving you—vibes drop dead.
Distance painful, mood on low,
Riding away, vibes mad slow.

Sonnet 51
Distance sucks, but thoughts fly quick,
My love speeds faster—Uber-slick.
Legit rushing back to your vibe,
Forget chillin’, fast-track ride.

Sonnet 52
Your love's rare drip, limited drop,
Flex exclusive—heart won’t stop.
Locked down treasures, waiting game,
Value doubled when you reclaim.

What’s your secret? You're every glow—
Summer vibes, beauty's pro.
You're the main character, no cap,
Others basic—you got map.

How protect you? Mind perplexed.
Bars locked tight, preserving love,

Watching good souls go broke.
