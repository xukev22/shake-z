his very genius hath taken the infection of the device,man.
tis not unknown to you,madam,i am a poor fellow.

but ere i name him,you fair lords,quoth she,speaking to those that came with collatine,shall plight your honourable faiths to me,with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine;for tis a meritorious fair design to chase injustice with revengeful arms.
but to the quick o thulcer:hamlet comes back:what would you undertake to show yourself your fathers son in deed,more than in words?
do you discharge upon mine hostess.
even thou,that hast a heart so tender oer it,take it hence,and see it instantly consumd with fire;even thou,and none but thou.
good people,bring a rescue or two.
fellow kings,i tell you that that lord saye hath gelded the commonwealth and made it an eunuch;and more than that,he can speak french,and therefore he is a traitor.
therefore,courage,good aliena.
large gifts have i bestowed on learned clerks,because my book preferred me to the king.
had i but seen thy picture in this plight it would have madded me.
