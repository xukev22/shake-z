therefore,fellow,i must have leave to pass.
finely put off!
and,for the babe is counted lost for ever,perdita i prithee callt.
but yet be wary in thy studious care.
it likes me well.
but wherefore stay we?
thou art pinchd for t now,sebastian.
next,hear my prayers.
but take heed to your kindness,though.
if this be so,the gods do mean to strike me to death with mortal joy.
with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that makst the fray.

she would never tell her parentage;being demanded that,she would sit still and weep.
and let this world no longer be a stage to feed contention in a lingering act;but let one spirit of the first-born cain reign in all bosoms,that,each heart being set on bloody courses,the rude scene may end,and darkness be the burier of the dead!
you that way,we this way.
the duke is humorous;what he is indeed more suits you to conceive than i to speak of.
o no,he lives,but is took prisoner,and lord scales with him,and lord hungerford;most of the rest slaughterd or took likewise.
he that has and a little tiny wit,with heigh-ho,the wind and the rain,must make content with his fortunes fit,though the rain it raineth every day.

but what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?
talk not,signior gremio;i say he shall go to prison.
nay,rather,wilt thou draw thy forces hence,confess who set thee up and plucked thee down,call warwick patron and be penitent,and thou shalt still remain the duke of york.
thou art a slave whom fortunes tender arm with favour never clasped,but bred a dog.
i have not that alacrity of spirit nor cheer of mind that i was wont to have.
all this divided york and lancaster,divided in their dire division.
no,as i am a christian:if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet,i am none.
if it be so,then both depart to him.
you spurn me hence,and he will spurn me hither.
all-worthy villain!
in which i have commended to his goodness the model of our chaste loves,his young daughter the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!
i have stayed for thee,god knows,in torment and in agony.
your goodness,since you provoke me,shall be most notorious.
will you go along with us?
thou wrongst a gentleman who is as far from thy report as thou from honour;and solicits here a lady that disdains thee and the devil alike.
come hither,gentle mistress:do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience?
besides,our nearness to the king in love is near the hate of those love not the king.
shall caesar send a lie?
princes,that strive by factions and by friends ambitiously for rule and empery,know that the people of rome,for whom we stand a special party,have by common voice,in election for the roman empery,chosen andronicus,surnamed pius for many good and great deserts to rome.

a hateful truth.
good time of day unto my gracious lord.
speedily i wish to hear from rome.
truly,madam,if god have lent a man any manners,he may easily put it off at court:he that cannot make a leg,put offs cap,kiss his hand,and say nothing,has neither leg,hands,lip,nor cap;and indeed such a fellow,to say precisely,were not for the court;but for me,i have an answer will serve all men.
a battle struck within;then a retreat.
ay,and to wage this battle at pharsalia,where caesar fought with pompey.
never came any from mine that might offend your majesty.
how now,mad wag?

father and mother is man and wife;man and wife is one flesh;and so,my mother.
tybalt would kill thee,but thou slewst tybalt;there art thou happy.
nay,that cannot be so neither.
i wish your worship well;god restore you to health!
i care not for good life.
lady,you are the cruelst she alive if you will lead these graces to the grave,and leave the world no copy.
but,brother anthony,come,tis no matter:do not you meddle,let me deal in this.
the heavens continue their loves!
go in with me,and counsel every man the aptest way for safety and revenge.
she,seeing him asleep,leaves him.
and after this,let caesar seat him sure,for we will shake him,or worse days endure.
why,as men do a-land;the great ones eat up the little ones:i can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale;a plays and tumbles,driving the poor fry before him,and at last devours them all at a mouthful.
you cur!
the commonwealth of athens is become a forest of beasts.
it pleaseth me so well,that i will see you wed;and then with what haste you can,get you to bed.
what sayst thou?
farewell,master;farewell,farewell!
he could be contented;why is he not,then?
nay,tarry,ill go along with thee.
it cannot be calld our mother,but our grave,where nothing,but who knows nothing,is once seen to smile;where sighs,and groans,and shrieks,that rent the air,are made,not markd;where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy.
i wot your love pursues a banished traitor.
come,let us in,and with all speed provide to see her coronation be performed.
because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts,and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud?
we will talk no more of this matter.
this had been truth,sir.
though not for me,yet for your vehement oaths,you should have been respective and have kept it.
tis marvel,but that you are but newly come you might have heard it else proclaimd about.
i did her wrong.
out,gall!
i am very ill at ease,unfit for mine own purposes.
dot,and to bed then.
but not a courtier,although they wear their faces to the bent of the kings looks,hath a heart that is not glad at the thing they scowl at.
this she wishd me to make known;but our great court made me to blame in memory.
then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow.
this is no place;this house is but a butchery.
o my lord,the times and titles now are altered strangely with me since first you knew me.
we are blessed in the change.
rain,to lay this wind,or my heart will be blown up by my throat!
all hail,sweet madam,and fair time of day.
merely our own traitors.
your coriolanus is not much missed but with his friends.
i have an hours talk in store for you:remember that you call on me today;be near me,that i may remember you.
some one way,some another.
katherine,queen of england,come into the court.
his affections do not that way tend,nor what he spake,though it lackd form a little,was not like madness.
re-enter achilles.
no words!
tis well bethought.
here comes more.
enough;no more;tis not so sweet now as it was before.
o husband!
where are my other men,monsieur?
masters,play here,i will content your pains,something thats brief;and bid good morrow,general.
what a pair of spectacles is here!
imprimis,she can milk.
alla stoccata carries it away.
tis nothing but conceit,my gracious lady.
out o your wits and hearing too?
not so,my lord.
though to have her and death were both one thing.
get me ink and paper,and hire post-horses.
we should by this,to all our lamentation,if he had gone forth consul,found it so.
i then moved you,my lord of canterbury,and got your leave to make this present summons.
gaze where you should,and that will clear your sight.
ill warrant you,fear me not.
well,lords,the duke of lancaster is dead.
let me live here ever.

good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
what,wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
ay me!
you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and provd effects,such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty;and that he willd me in heedfullst reservation to bestow them,as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note.
what,art a heathen?
oui,vraiment,sauf votre grce,ainsi dit-il.
you do mistake me,sir.
well,bear you well in this new spring of time,lest you be cropped before you come to prime.
why,uncle,whats the matter?
i shall not want false witness to condemn me,nor store of treasons to augment my guilt.
o,the heavens!
the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me;and these thy offices,so rarely kind,are as interpreters of my behind-hand slackness!
my father,poorly led?
thats strange.
but now a king,now thus.
content thee,prince;i will restore to thee the peoples hearts,and wean them from themselves.
tis you that have the reason.
so god help warwick,as he loves the land and common profit of his country!
she did betray me to my own reproof.
the gods give him joy,and make him good friend to the people!
tis meet so,daughter;but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame,which sorrow is always toward ourselves,not heaven,showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,but as we stand in fear i do repent me as it is an evil,and take the shame with joy.
my nursh-a quickly tell me so mush.
and for my sake,when i might charm thee so,for she that was thy lucrece,now attend me:be suddenly revenged on my foe,thine,mine,his own.
may your grace speak of it?
go to,i faith;and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke,wear the print of it and sigh away sundays.
edward and richard,you shall stay with me;my brother montague shall post to london.
rehearse that once more.
come on;well visit caliban my slave,who never yields us kind answer.
so foul and fair a day i have not seen.
art thou his father?
ha,thou mountain-foreigner!

heaven hath my empty words,whilst my invention,hearing not my tongue,anchors on isabel.
of that and all the progress more and less,resolvedly more leisure shall express.
chiron,thy years wants wit,thy wit wants edge and manners,to intrude where i am graced,and may,for aught thou knowest,affected be.
i fear it much;and i do fear besides that i shall lose distinction in my joys;as doth a battle,when they charge on heaps the enemy flying.
warwick may lose that now hath won the day.
i prithee,speak.
i prithee,give no limits to my tongue.
to brag unto them,thus i did,and thus!
with lawyers in the vacation;for they sleep between term and term,and then they perceive not how time moves.
do not consume your blood with sorrowing;have you a nurse of me?
so that this land,like an offensive wife that hath enraged him on to offer strokes,as he is striking,holds his infant up and hangs resolved correction in the arm that was upreard to execution.
marry,whip the gosling:i think i shall have something to do with you.
speak softly.
tis calld the evil:a most miraculous work in this good king;which often,since my here-remain in england,i have seen him do.
take heed,ere summer comes,or cuckoo birds do sing.
i am famished in his service.
why,so didst thou.
let my sovereign turn away his face and bid his ears a little while be deaf,till i have told this slander of his blood how god and good men hate so foul a liar.
come,come,my son,ill bring thee on thy way.
what is the fourth?
thou canst strike,canst thou?
it hath done meritorious service.

of what personage and years is he?
what comfort is for claudio?
would twere so!
my train are men of choice and rarest parts,that all particulars of duty know;and in the most exact regard support the worships of their name.
let hercules himself do what he may,the cat will mew,and dog will have his day.
if it live in your memory,begin at this line,let me see,let me see:the rugged pyrrhus,like th hyrcanian beast,it is not so:it begins with pyrrhusthe rugged pyrrhus,he whose sable arms,black as his purpose,did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse,hath now this dread and black complexion smeard with heraldry more dismal.
nay,that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage,as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it.
none do you like but an effeminate prince,whom like a school-boy you may overawe.
instruct my daughter how she shall persever,that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent.
the bishop and the duke of gloucesters men,forbidden late to carry any weapon,have filld their pockets full of pebble stones and,banding themselves in contrary parts,do pelt so fast at one anothers pate that many have their giddy brains knockd out;our windows are broke down in every street,and we for fear compelld to shut our shops.
the gates are open;let us enter too.
your grant or your denial shall be mine.
yon kings to me like to my fathers picture,which tells me in that glory once he was;had princes sit,like stars,about his throne,and he the sun,for them to reverence;none that beheld him,but,like lesser lights,did vail their crowns to his supremacy:where now his sons like a glow-worm in the night,the which hath fire in darkness,none in light:whereby i see that times the king of men,hes both their parent,and he is their grave,and gives them what he will,not what they crave.

look upon the years of louis the dauphin and that lovely maid.
down with them,fleece them!
but fare thee well,thou art a gallant youth.
who hath sent thee now?
and thy father was duke of milan,and his only heir and princess,no worse issued.
so when this thief,this traitor,bolingbroke,who all this while hath revelled in the night whilst we were wandring with the antipodes,shall see us rising in our throne,the east,his treasons will sit blushing in his face,not able to endure the sight of day,but self-affrighted,tremble at his sin.

then,dear my liege,mine honour let me try;in that i live,and for that will i die.
did you see master lorenzo?
a woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
this toil of ours should be a work of thine;but thou from loving england art so far that thou hast underwrought his lawful king,cut off the sequence of posterity,outfaced infant state,and done a rape upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
prevent it,resist it,let it not be so,lest child,childs children,cry against you,woe!
i will buy with you,sell with you,talk with you,walk with you,and so following;but i will not eat with you,drink with you,nor pray with you.
i humbly thank your highness.

there,my music playing far off,i will betray tawny-finned fishes.

has he never before sounded you in this business?
another part of the plain.
now,charmian!
vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,that i may prompt them;and of such as have,i humbly pray them to admit the excuse of time,of numbers,and due course of things,which cannot in their huge and proper life be here presented.

and i had mine!
i talkd with no man at that hour,my lord.
those wits that think they have thee,do very oft prove fools;and i that am sure i lack thee,may pass for a wise man.
thy george,profaned,hath lost his lordly honour;thy garter,blemished,pawned his knightly virtue;thy crown,usurped,disgraced his kingly glory.
must it be so?
o,if you raise this house against this house,it will the woefullest division prove that ever fell upon this cursed earth.
sufficeth a roman with a romans heart can suffer.
my gracious lord,i may be negligent,foolish,and fearful;in every one of these no man is free,but that his negligence,his folly,fear,among the infinite doings of the world,sometime puts forth.
and so they are.
flout em and cout em,and scout em and flout em:thought is free.

how a usurers wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burden,and how she longed to eat adders heads and toads carbonadoed.

then no,my lord.
hath any well-advised friend proclaimed reward to him that brings the traitor in?
we will be satisfied;let us be satisfied.
your judgments,my grave lords,must give this cur the lie;and his own notion who wears my stripes impressed upon him,that must bear my beating to his graveshall join to thrust the lie unto him.
your presence glads our days;honour we love;for who hates honour hates the gods above.
thus weary of the world,away she hies,and yokes her silver doves;by whose swift aid their mistress mounted through the empty skies,in her light chariot quickly is conveyd;holding their course to paphos,where their queen means to immure herself and not be seen.

i would he were!
my love is most immaculate white and red.
i do it not in evil disposition,but from lord angelo by special charge.
pronounce but love and dove;speak to my gossip venus one fair word,one nickname for her purblind son and heir,young abraham cupid,he that shot so trim when king cophetua lovd the beggar-maid.

did you but know the citys usuries,and felt them knowingly;the art o th court,as hard to leave as keep,whose top to climb is certain falling,or so slippry that the fears as bad as falling;the toil o th war,a pain that only seems to seek out danger i th name of fame and honour,which dies i th search,and hath as oft a slandrous epitaph as record of fair act;nay,many times,doth ill deserve by doing well;whats worse,must curtsy at the censure.

this is the rarest dream that eer dull sleep did mock sad fools withal:this cannot be:my daughter,buried.
speak quickly,or i shoot.
yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a fallen lord does conquer him that did his master conquer,and earns a place i th story.
alas,sir,how fell you besides your five wits?
now,if the help of norfolk and myself,with all the friends that thou,brave earl of march,amongst the loving welshmen canst procure,will but amount to five and twenty thousand,why,via,to london will we march amain,and once again bestride our foaming steeds,and once again cry charge upon our foes!
thus can my love excuse the slow offence,of my dull bearer,when from thee i speed,from where thou art,why should i haste me thence?
shall we set about some revels?
my lord,i fear,has forgot britain.

let us take any mans horses.
play with your fancies;and in them behold upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;hear the shrill whistle which doth order give to sounds confusd;behold the threaden sails,borne with the invisible and creeping wind,draw the huge bottoms through the furrowd sea,breasting the lofty surge.

at the dukes oak we meet.
mistress ford desires you to come suddenly.
i cannot say whore,it does abhor me now i speak the word;to do the act that might the addition earn not the worlds mass of vanity could make me.
what,the chain?
for though my soul disputes well with my sense that this may be some error,but no madness,yet doth this accident and flood of fortune so far exceed all instance,all discourse,that i am ready to distrust mine eyes and wrangle with my reason that persuades me to any other trust but that i am mad,or else the ladys mad;yet if twere so,she could not sway her house,command her followers,take and give back affairs and their dispatch,with such a smooth,discreet,and stable bearing as i perceive she does.

the matter is to me,sir,as concerning jaquenetta.
what i dare too well do,i dare not do.
the sweet embraces of a loving wife,loaden with kisses,armed with thousand cupids,shall never clasp our necks;no issue know us,no figures of ourselves shall we eer see,to glad our age,and like young eagles teach em boldly to gaze against bright arms and say remember what your fathers were,and conquer!

weeds of athens he doth wear:this is he,my master said,despisd the athenian maid;and here the maiden,sleeping sound,on the dank and dirty ground.

why should this change of thoughts,the sad companion,dull-eyed melancholy,be my so used a guest as not an hour in the days glorious walk or peaceful night,the tomb where grief should sleep,can breed me quiet?
i come to know what prisoners thou hast taen,and to survey the bodies of the dead.
have you not set mine honour at the stake,and baited it with all th unmuzzled thoughts that tyrannous heart can think?
away,disperse!
would i were in an alehouse in london!
o mischief strangely thwarting!
whos born that day when i forget to send to antony shall die a beggar.
i speak not this in estimation,as what i think might be,but what i know is ruminated,plotted,and set down,and only stays but to behold the face of that occasion that shall bring it on.
beseech you,tribunes,hear me but a word.
now,sir,thought is free.
that monster custom,who all sense doth eat,of habits evil,is angel yet in this,that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on.

o,how,lychorida,how does my queen?
and i for no woman.
therefore,my lord,go travel for a while,till that his rage and anger be forgot,or till the destinies do cut his thread of life.

no,indeed,will i not,pompey;it is not the wear.
yourself and i will not be there.
i cannot get him out o th house.
to punish me for what you make me do seems much unequal.
but we have been deceivd in thy integrity,deceivd in that which seems so.
where have you this?
i go.
good sister,let us dine,and never fret;a man is master of his liberty;time is their master,and when they see time,theyll go or come.
how many months do you desire?
marry,to say she came to seek you there.
tis exactly valued,not petty things admitted.
jove and my stars be praised!
let us lay hands upon him.
but even then the morning cock crew loud,and at the sound it shrunk in haste away,and vanishd from our sight.

we were dead of sleep,and,how,we know not,all clappd under hatches,where,but even now,with strange and several noises of roaring,shrieking,howling,jingling chains,and mo diversity of sounds,all horrible,we were awakd;straightway,at liberty:where we,in all her trim,freshly beheld our royal,good,and gallant ship;our master capring to eye her.
well said,thart a good fellow.
i hope shes pleased;her signs were gracious.
let none presume to wear an undeserved dignity.
cousin,on wednesday next our council we will hold at windsor,so inform the lords:but come yourself with speed to us again,for more is to be said and to be done than out of anger can be uttered.
and well met,gentlemen.
who struck this heat up after i was gone?
use me but as your spaniel,spurn me,strike me,neglect me,lose me;only give me leave,unworthy as i am,to follow you.
but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man,and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornationshall it be,that you a world of curses undergo,being the agents,or base second means,the cords,the ladder,or the hangman rather?
pardon me,proteus,all i can is nothing to her,whose worth makes other worthies nothing;she is alone.
but what said warwick to these injuries?
again in triumph,and mercutio slain?
sit still,and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
i do repent me.
why then thou hast it;two deep enemies,foes to my rest,and my sweet sleeps disturbers,are they that i would have thee deal upon.
never was seen so black a day as this.
nay,my lord,he calld you jack,and said he would cudgel you.
beseech you,father!

forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature;for my rage was blind,and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art.
my wit is at an end.
who comes here?
sir,i am a poor friend of yours,that loves you.
therefore i say again,i utterly abhor,yea,from my soul refuse you for my judge,whom,yet once more,i hold my most malicious foe and think not at all a friend to truth.
tis certain,every man that dies ill,the ill upon his own head,the king is not to answer for it.

or that there were such men whose heads stood in their breasts?
reverend sirs,for you theres rosemary and rue;these keep seeming and savour all the winter long.
how but well,sir?
this place is dangerous;the time right deadly;i beseech you,go.
sleepest or wakest thou,jolly shepherd?
mistake me not;i speak but as i find.
how shall we then dispense with that contract,and not deface your honour with reproach?
what shall i do?
look as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,make slow pursuit,or altogether balk the prey wherein by nature they delight;so surfeit-taking tarquin fares this night.
i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:theyll have me whipped for speaking true;thoult have me whipped for lying;and sometimes i am whipped for holding my peace.
now bid me run,and i will strive with things impossible,yea,get the better of them.

which when her sad-beholding husband saw,amazedly in her sad face he stares.
fidele,sir.
doubt thou the stars are fire,doubt that the sun doth move,doubt truth to be a liar,but never doubt i love.
wherefore dost thou mad me?
not that i think you did not love your father,but that i know love is begun by time,and that i see,in passages of proof,time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
this is all.

o my sweet lady,pardon.
the villain is alive in titus house,and as he is to witness,this is true.

a soul feminine saluteth us.
i will not believe such a cataian,though the priest o the town commended him for a true man.

for none neither.
for i am shamed by that which i bring forth,and so should you,to love things nothing worth.

now follow,if thou darst,to try whose right,of thine or mine,is most in helena.
i will present my honest grief unto him and as my lord still serve him with my life.

i have no precious time at all to spend;nor services to do till you require.
season your admiration for a while with an attent ear,till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you.
ill bear thee hence;and let them fight that will,for i have murdered where i should not kill.
tell him,and spare not.
and from thy hated presence part i so:see me no more,whether he be dead or no.

if i cry out thus upon no trail,never trust me when i open again.
i can live no longer by thinking.

my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,while i,their king,that thither them importune,do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them,because myself do want my servants fortune.
nay,then thou lovst it not,and all my pains is sorted to no proof.
i will go seek the king.

lo you,my lord,the net has falln upon me.
but what occasion hath cadwal now to give it motion?
my ariel,chick,that is thy charge:then to the elements be free,and fare thou well!
to conclude:this drudge or diviner laid claim to me,called me dromio,swore i was assured to her,told me what privy marks i had about me,as the mark of my shoulder,the mole in my neck,the great wart on my left arm,that i,amazed,ran from her as a witch.

look you,my good lord,i must entreat you,honour me so much as to advance this jewel.
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
and who is your deer?
god send us peace!
good signior,you shall more command with years than with your weapons.
i would not there reside,to put my father in impatient thoughts,by being in his eye.
wilt thou forsake thy fortune,bequeath thy land to him,and follow me?
what now ensues,to the judgement your eye i give,my cause who best can justify.
quoth i.
prithee,read i thy right wits.
i give him you,the noblest that survives,the eldest son of this distressed queen.
bring him with triumph home unto his house.
what quality?
all the better;their fraction is more our wish than their faction.
and god forbid,my dear and faithful lord,that you should fashion,wrest,or bow your reading,or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate,whose right suits not in native colours with the truth;for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to.
you will set cock-a-hoop,youll be the man!

the aged man that coffers up his gold is plagued with cramps,and gouts and painful fits,and scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,but like still-pining tantalus he sits,and useless barns the harvest of his wits,having no other pleasure of his gain but torment that it cannot cure his pain.
heigh,my hearts!
alas,thrice-gentle cassio,my advocation is not now in tune;my lord is not my lord;nor should i know him were he in favour as in humour alterd.
yes,hes a fine man.
and patient fools,whose children he hath slain,their base throats tear with giving him glory.
he hath deserved worthily of his country,and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,having been supple and courteous to the people,bonnetted,without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report;but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury.

bastard of orleans,thrice welcome to us.
but do you remember?
the wound of peace is surety,surety secure;but modest doubt is calld the beacon of the wise,the tent that searches to th bottom of the worst.
the arbitrement is like to be bloody.
and so,my lord,adieu.
how are they escoted?
here is your husband,like a mildewd ear blasting his wholesome brother.
thy business?
you touched my vein at first.
thanks,good sir.
who gave thee this letter?
we must follow the leaders.
saving your merry humour,heres the note how much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,the fineness of the gold,and chargeful fashion,which doth amount to three odd ducats more than i stand debted to this gentleman.

and for my means,ill husband them so well,they shall go far with little.
lets away;follow me.

thou partst a fair fray.
i took him sleepingthat is finishd too and the athenian woman by his side,that,when he wakd,of force she must be eyd.

it is my duty,sir.
why,do you think she is not honest,sir?
theres more to be considerd;but well even all that good time will give us.
