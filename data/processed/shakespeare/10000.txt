at last,though long,our jarring notes agree:and time it is when raging war is done,to smile at scapes and perils overblown.
the fault will be in the music,cousin,if you be not wooed in good time:if the prince be too important,tell him there is measure in everything,and so dance out the answer.
the lunatic,the lover,and the poet are of imagination all compact:one sees more devils than vast hell can hold;that is the madman:the lover,all as frantic,sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt:the poets eye,in a fine frenzy rolling,doth glance from heaven to earth,from earth to heaven;and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown,the poets pen turns them to shapes,and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name.

or,if i live,is it not very like,the horrible conceit of death and night,together with the terror of the place,as in a vault,an ancient receptacle,where for this many hundred years the bones of all my buried ancestors are packd,where bloody tybalt,yet but green in earth,lies festering in his shroud;where,as they say,at some hours in the night spirits resort alack,alack,is it not like that i,so early waking,what with loathsome smells,and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,that living mortals,hearing them,run mad.

ill conjure you,ill fortune-tell you.
let me not,hubert,or,hubert,if you will,cut out my tongue,so i may keep mine eyes.
the trumpets sound a sennet.
assist,good friends.
and believe it,my most honoured lord,for any benefit that points to me,either in hope or present,id exchange for this one wish,that you had power and wealth to requite me by making rich yourself.

nay,look not big,nor stamp,nor stare,nor fret;i will be master of what is mine own.
right well,dear madam.

why,this is the very samethe very hand,the very words.
nay,be thou sure ill well requite thy kindness,for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;ay,such a pleasure as incaged birds conceive when,after many moody thoughts,at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty.

that such an ass should owe them.
firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have passed upon her.
i will roar that i will make the duke say let him roar again,let him roar again.if you should do it too terribly,you would fright the duchess and the ladies,that they would shriek;and that were enough to hang us all.

one of lord timons men?
yet i confess that often ere this day,when i have heard your kings desert recounted,mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
why that way?
to whom?
some attend him.
and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion,grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
whos there,besides foul weather?
at which,as it were by inspiration,she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven.
nay,good troth.
my affections are then most humble;i have no ambition to see a goodlier man.
this lodovico is a proper man.
bring him with triumph home unto his house.
have you your wits?
which three till now,never kept seat in one.
take thou that.
no,make it two more;let it be written in eight and eight.
this fellows of exceeding honesty,and knows all qualities,with a learned spirit,of human dealings.
canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
the ruddock would,with charitable bill(o bill,sore shaming those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie without a monument!)bring thee all this;yea,and furrd moss besides,when flowrs are none,to winter-ground thy corse prithee have done,and do not play in wench-like words with that which is so serious.
the rest shall bear the business in some other fight,as cause will be obeyed.
set you down this.

his grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning.
are the knights ready to begin the triumph?
troy must not be,nor goodly ilion stand;our firebrand brother,paris,burns us all.
madam,he comforts you can make you greater than the queen of goths.
i pray thee go to the casement,and see if you can see my master,master doctor caius,coming.

and now this ornament makes me look dismal will i clip to form;and what this fourteen years no razor touchd to grace thy marriage-day,ill beautify.
most dread liege,the good i stand on is my truth and honesty.
i had myself twenty angels given me this morning,but i defy all angels in any such sort,as they say,but in the way of honesty.
the patch is kind enough,but a huge feeder,snail-slow in profit,and he sleeps by day more than the wild-cat.
come,high or low;thyself and office deftly show!
it is but foolery;but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.
and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency,yet opinion,a sovereign mistress of effects,throws a more safer voice on you:you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition.
there is no other way,unless thou couldst put on some other shape,and not be richard,that hath done all this.
his son am i;deny it if you can.
my master and my lord i must obey.
ay,so the bishop be not overborne.
he must,and will.prithee,now,say you will,and go about it.
i am sure he had more hair on his tail than i have on my face when i last saw him.
o ratcliffe,i have dreamed a fearful dream!
i knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel,but when the parties were met themselves,one of them thought but of an if,as,if you said so,then i said so;and they shook hands,and swore brothers.
as he passed along,how earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!
will you not suffer me?
fairwell,revolted fair!
blest,and mine own!
now shine it like a comet of revenge,a prophet to the fall of all our foes!
i have checked him for it,and the young lion repents.
whoeer he be,that in this foul proceeding,hath thus beguild your daughter of herself,and you of her,the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter,after your own sense,yea,though our proper son stood in your action.
but dost thou hear?
it suffices me thou art.
all those for this?
all-worthy villain!
by this account,then,margaret may win him,for shes a woman to be pitied much.
thou hast a better place in his affection than all thy brothers.
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
go,suck the subtle blood o th grape till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,and so scape hanging.
her dotage now i do begin to pity.
now,by this maiden blossom in my hand,i scorn thee and thy fashion,peevish boy.
what love,thinkst thou,i sue so much to get?
thou hadst a clarence too,and richard killed him.
how is it with her?
this womans answer sorts,for womanish it is to be from thence.
that done,trudge with it in all haste,and carry it among the whitsters in datchet mead,and there empty it in the muddy ditch close by the thames side.

i am young;but something you may deserve of him through me;and wisdom to offer up a weak,poor,innocent lamb to appease an angry god.
i must forsake the court:to dot,or no,is certain to me a break-neck.
this is not hunters language.
as well as one so great and so forlorn may hold together:on her frights and griefs,(which never tender lady hath borne greater)she is,something before her time,deliverd.
i would with such perfection govern,sir,t excel the golden age.
the foul fiend follows me!
a good wench,give it me.

ferdinand,my father,king of spain,was reckoned one the wisest prince that there had reigned by many a year before.
wheres your master?
i am one,sir,that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs.
shall it be so?
alas,for whose sake did i that ill deed?
because we come to do you service,and you think we are ruffians,youll have your daughter coverd with a barbary horse;youll have your nephews neigh to you;youll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
one fruitful meal would set me tot.

colevile shall be still your name,a traitor your degree,and the dungeon your place,a place deep enough;so shall you be still colevile of the dale.
i pray,sirplague upont!
i am,sir,under the king,in some authority.
