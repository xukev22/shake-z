yo bro, pass me your shaky hand—if fear got you bailing like me, then ditch that gross, savage maw.
lucius, big ups to romes chill governor!
im over it, no more talk.
yo rogues, scram!
drop the tough act and chill; if you wanna roast us, go ahead.
hey kid, i think youre hella bummed.
i wont hold any swag that isnt already all yours.
i got you—ill drop everything and hook you up with smooth seas, lit winds, and a ride so fast your royal crew gets left in the dust.
aight, my liege, hand over my dads land just like he wanted.
until hes gasping and pulls that heavenly drip from her dope coral lips—so hard they end up stuck and crash to the ground.
you vibing with my rants, or am i just clowning?
im leveling up while you rack up mad respect.
sis, theres no fix for that.
hes gonna come through, for real.
slide jessica the word: i wont let her down—keep it 100, talk on the low.
you down to love a girl like that?
so flex your best drip, tell your crew; if youre tying the knot tomorrow, its a go—and same for rosalind.
just chill, patience is key.
screw all the cowards, fr.
he went off about my eyes and hair being all black, and now im catching major shade.
both a reality check and some guidance gotta hit this rude dude before he can level up.
its all about the real value, not the basic stuff.
theyre clashing, and with the king in deep, prince henry rolls in.
hope he aint as sus as he came off in his squads trial.
im bouncing from you.
this beat is mad annoying to my vibe.
gloucester, you gotta drop an answer—like, before the pope does.
i jotted down what he said for my sis: if shes cool with him and his hundred knights, then when i show hes wack, oswald can slide back in.
yeah, thats the move.
fr, is that legit?
aw man, why you trippin over this order?
heard that guilty peeps at a play got so deep in the scene they ended up confessing all their shady moves.
straight to bed, fam.
major win, major win, major win!
yo, peep his drip!
so yeah, even though i lowkey hate him, i gotta flash that love badge for now.
ive been chillin here a bit longer.
its gaultree forest—should totally please your vibe.
my hearts too wrecked to drop a lame goodbye.
sometimes we call our own shots—yo brutus, it aint the stars, its on us for being basic.
id have you live, even though dying is kinda the ultimate happy vibe, no cap.
your breath is on point, my dearest thisbe.
no cap, i aint down to commit that deep sin even for all the land.
lame dudes using them for such basic moves!
i wont mess with your crib.
news is totally flip-flop.
whats your game plan?
like apemantus rn, im straight-up hating that lord.
oh lord, these days are mad dangerous.
you can keep clowning, but swear, i aint vibing with these councils.
i hate goodbyes, so were bouncing.
hecubas boobs when nursing hector werent any prettier than hectors forehead when it was spitting blood at that greek sword.
pirithous, keep the feast poppin; dont drag on.
my lord, im lowkey protesting—cut the cuss words.
like, the trees shouldve grown dudes, but expectation just died waiting for what it never had.
i trust you, fam.
laertes, what would you beg for that aint in my deal, bro?
every weak vice has gotta flex some semblance of virtue outwardly.
maam, im in.
they call it agincourt.
i see a dude here who aint gotta work shifts when the streets drop golden gifts.
my ladys off to cop some horns, but if you get hitched, hang me if those horns flop.
delicate ariel, imma set you free for this, no cap.
bro, sit next to me and vibe.
listen up, our steeds are trippin, all set to serve.
should i go peep the market?
yo, if we rob the thieves and roll to london, wed have debate material for a week, memes for a month, and jokes for life.
my tongue-tied muse is chilling while all the sick praise for you gets flexed with a golden vibe and epic phrases.
aww, where you at?
you thinking of yeeting yourself?
bassanio, lemme know whats up; if youre still rockin that honor, know my wallet, my self, and everythings at your call.
thats a dope rogue.
my honest friend, roll up to me by tomorrow morning.
this piece is fire, madam—if only it was done!
god, i hope my news is on point for you, lord.
this went down tonight.
i read up on the reason behind his moves in galen.
sea fight, lets get it.
whats the sitch here?
pardon me, caesar; my baes insisting i drop this info, and loves riding on it.
why are the emperors horns blasting so extra?
havent got all their messages to link up in arms by the 9th next month, and arent some sent already?
why does it seem like i aint?
this is gonna be a holy day vibe from here on out.
id take ten shares, no doubt.
a super short, lame scene of young pyramus and his thisbe—tragically funny.
sir, please dont skip this hefty offer—it hardly drops in sorrow, and when it does, its a legit comfort.
gods with you, fam!
then he got pressed to repeat my tale—the duke said he wasnt really speaking for himself.
i see your downfall, and its basically wrecking me.
watch me level up and get knighted.
right on her forehead, all geared up, battling her hair.
this maze is weird af, way beyond what anyones ever done; someones gotta set the record straight.
damn, you handle love so sweetly, totally spotting the heartbreak in its glow.
is he in this squad?
proculeius, your moves are out—caesars already called you up.
give me that satisfaction, aight?
nah, no, not like that—youre totally off.
my mom says your vibe totally shocked and impressed her.
and every day, they cook up new demands—as if freebies, favs, and random acts were on tap.
she can spot whats been and whats about to go down.
yo master constable, tie these dudes up and haul ‘em to leonatos; im rolling up to show him whats up with them.
later, my bosses; im off—gonna spark bonfires in france ASAP to keep saint georges feast lit.
but yo, my knight and guest—you get this victory crown and youre crowned king of todays vibes.
sir john, i know your shady style of twisting the truth into bogus.
their bloods crusted and ice cold, barely flowing; zero warm vibes, and natures built for a slow, heavy drag back to earth.
please, get yourself suited up and flex your honor just like your forebears did.
cassius, what crazy risks are you pulling, making me search for vibes i dont even have?
a chill lady vibe is giving us a shout.
if your eye aint just buttering up, slide over and speak up for me—a broke prince that no one gives a damn about.
cool, were on the same page.
yo, your king already caught wind of augustus.
bounce, say peace out, and let me hear you dip.
honestly, i didnt even know you.
cut your song and dip, ‘cause here comes a chill dude whose advice usually calms my drama.
so, peace out until we link up again.
all our overhyped hustle, done and redone, was nothing compared to the massive honors you stack on our crib—old-school vibes and fresh titles, we owe it all to that.
portia, whats your take?
now you get why were in such a rush?
lets bounce and dip while our patience even makes fortune shake when shes at her worst.
my dude, hows your rep holding up these days?
the corioles crew just rolled out and threw down with lartius and martius.
cant even front that its from the baller cardinal and the fresh duke of suffolk, but thats just how it is.
ugh, thats weak!
believe me, babe, even in this dead silence i found a welcome vibe; and doing my duty gave me more intel than that extra, bold chatter ever could.
i might just tie the knot with this chick for pulling that move.
he didnt have time to squad up; he needed pikes for his archers, so they yanked sharp stakes outta hedges and slammed ‘em down to block the cavalry.
my wrecked body, drained blood, and weak heart are screaming that i gotta tap out and let my enemy snag the win.
maybe, to keep it classy, ill drop a tribute when she checks out for good.
yo, where my squad at?
try and convince me to be a pawn for this wack groom.
nah, aint nobody here.
chill, take a seat.
this is the drama we bring; no lie, its endless and wild trying to catch up to him—were so weak, barely keeping our head above water.
dont get it twisted, im not spitting this out of pure fear of you.
alright, alright, check it.
do your thing, good keeper.
which homie?
hes off to parthia.
bounce out quick; my hearts loaded with kindness and im so much like my mom that even the smallest slip has my eyes spilling all the tea.
signed, and check out how much he digs the clown that is your wife!
but if your dad had copped the win, he wouldnt be repping coventry; the whole country was like ‘nah on him, and all the love went to hereford—who got mad props, even over the king.
now my messed-up roderigo, totally flipped by love, got lit with desdemona tonight—drinking deep while on watch—and three cyprus dudes, all noble but chill, true reps of this warlike island, got smashed with flowing cups while they peeped the scene.
i wish i coulda drop those feelings in a way that hits harder.
what would he even do if he had the same fire and trigger for passion as me?
maria once said she was into me, and i heard she got so close that if shes feeling it, its totally matching my vibe.
you know, a doublet, a hat, or a cloak aint gonna make or break a man.
im stoked on that.
oh my god, lord.
peep that, my dudes.
the beef and drama that blew up from your dukes savage clapback at merchants—our legit country folks needing cash—has sealed his strict rules with blood, so theres zero pity in our glare.
even the next willow—just handle your own grind, ya feel?
her vibe, poor thing, looked lighter but still tragic, got blown away fast, and we thought three dudes were scooped up by corinth fishermen.
heres my stamp, the death seal that tags you for hell.
yo, they look tired?
nah, keep it short; i can see your downfall, and im almost grown up already.
but i still love you, and honestly, i reckon you love me back.
big thanks for hooking me up with him.
grab some linen—this issues gotta get sorted, ‘cause her comeback is straight-up lethal.
lets roll out and gather up, fast.
oh god, like, my tongue that just dissed that proud dude so hard is now backtracking with honest words!
whats up with these dudes?
but boss, if i were the sexton, id have been chillin in the belfry that day.
like, in what?
all the nasty horrors in deep hell, sweet suffolk; youre just hurting yourself, and these curses bounce back on you like sunlight on a mirror or an overcharged gun.
the wild, smashed parties ripping into the thracian singer in a frenzy?
laertes is gonna be king!
more wasps buzzing around his nose means the stings gonna hit sooner.
chill, be content.
youre gonna glow up before i even risk saying anything.
i was down, but i gotta say, being exiled hurts way more than dying here at home.
i heard the scoop on your dead lords, and it hit me so hard its sparking my revenge vibes.
plantagenet, for all your clout, dont think henrys gonna get overthrown like that.
if you bump into horatio and marcellus—my watch squad rivals—tell ‘em to hustle up.
yo, thats the bonus that comes with being drop-dead gorgeous.
who, aeneas?
ill let you get back to your prayers, and in between, im dropping my wishes.
because then its like id totally lose myself.
he totally switched it up when he heard the news.
who even are you, and how did you roll up here, where no one ever shows up except that sad-ass dog who drops food to keep misfortune alive?
whats with these dodgy, hempy fits were rocking here, right by the fairy queens crib?
come on, my dudes, lets roll and vibe with edward to cheer him up.
nah, im begging you—seriously, spill who it is.
we arent even close to what we drop for you.
hes gonna be the ninth one worth it.
taking out our enemies—the blood hes spilled, i swear, is more than what hes dropped for his country—and if he loses the rest, itd mark us for life, no cap.
your wife and brother went to war on me, and their beef became your whole vibe—you were the ultimate war flex.
how real is he?
im super pissed, venting about my daughter hermia.
yo, do you have a past example of this job?
everywhere, he just bounces and grabs—his skills follow his cravings so hard he pulls off the impossible.
nah, please, keep it under wraps.
you bunch of gross breakouts and plagues, plastered all over so people can hate you even more, and infect each other like theres no tomorrow!
or should we just shut our traps and ghost through the rest of these cursed days?
timons bailing to the woods, where even the harshest animal is way nicer than humans.
yo, did you peep master lorenzo?
i see ‘em now; those were the days.
everyone would be thinking it; youre a straight-up legend for vibing like the rest of us.
oxford, whats the deal in this smooth chat—you totally skipped how henry the sixth lost everything henry the fifth scored.
i wish i could just dip out completely!
and since, i reckon i wouldnt glow up that fast—real beauty takes time while the basic stuff grows on fast.
the worst is just frontin and throwing extra shade.
you and your stuff aint really yours if you waste yourself over flexing virtues—theyre on you.
yo, your ladys dad!
yo, eros, hold up!
and then you switch your eyes from him to the duke, trying to call him out for being straight-up unfair?
so now, the gates are open.
cleopatra, even the tiniest hint of this, and shes done.
now, my flyest friend, i wish i had some spring blooms to light up your day—for you, still blossoming on that fresh vibe.
but if youre down to keep it 100, drop me a promise so i never gotta doubt you.
so, seize the moment—with a hey, a ho, and a hey nonino—‘cause love gets its crown in spring when the birds are straight vibin, ding ding ding.
if they offed your husband, then be hyped, ‘cause the law just got even with them.
god made him, so let him roll as a real dude.
when he walks, hes like a beast on an engine—and the ground cant handle his stride.
thats the same sir john, legit the same one.
if youre the one, please chill and let me drop the message i gotta deliver.
if theres any spark left, deep down in hell, tell ‘em i sent you—the ones with zero pity, love, or fear.
antony and potpan, yo!
lady, make your move.
nah, youre gonna fight your heart out before i let you bounce.
your vibe is young, and youll catch my drift when i start shining.
come on, good lorenzo.
show me the proof, or, for real, by the weight of a mans soul, youd be better off born a mutt than catchin my wrath.
so be real; your cheeks are confessing it and your eyes are screaming the truth—only your stubborn side keeps you quiet.
ugh, seriously, what lame vibes and insane nonsense are yall throwing around!
follow me and ride with me, ‘cause you gotta dip eventually.
no doubt, i was into her and jumped on her in that wild, reckless youth mode.
dang, poor duke!
i got your back, your ladyship.
should we give it up loud without coughin, spittin, or sayin were hoarse—‘cause thats just the intro to a weak vibe?
flip that fake face, you traitor, and cough up your life for my ride.
our battles are over.
all-hallow eve, yo.
repeat that—whered you ditch those punks?
you headin to scone?
why, bro?
a bold, brave guy.
praise god, i totally get it.
cheer up, my liege.
consumption, catch ya!
nah, the dust shouldve soared to heavens roof, kicked up by your massive squad.
which ones that barnardine?
youre speaking so dark and deadly!
this right here, in front of you.
sir, let me be real—have you ever peeped baptistas daughter?
im down for you.
the bond that wisdom cant lock down gets undone easy by foolery.
you can only push as hard as shes willing; your threats are as weak as her low-key prayers.
alright, lets dip and say whats done.
hes so self-absorbed that only another self-lover can vibe with him.
the lt on guard tonight—first off, gotta say: desdemonas totally into him.
what kind of fear is this thats tryna shake us?
and ill stick around so you forget every other spot but this one.
harry the fourth, or fifth?
yo, how the wheel totally suits it!
no wrinkles allowed!
i can witness that, and no traitors ever done a harsher move.
bounce, and do it quick!
why isnt oxford here as another solid anchor?
an ass aint enough—hes basically both a dumbass and a beast.
with this pass, you can link up with silvia all you want—shes chunky, moody, and for real, shed be down if you could convince her to diss young valentine and ride with my homie.
let it be—his way of dying, his low-key burial, no trophies, swords, or flashy signs over his bones, no proper send-off, all shouting so loud its like heaven calling, that i gotta call it out.
theyre prepping by sea today; were not vibing with them on land.
that kind of rapid move with chill advice and calm order in a fierce cause seriously needs an example.
the dude who got you to this banquet will dish out all the flavor to you.
cassandra, come back with priam.
i summoned you for a low-key sad occasion.
did you dip out while you were still young?
a friend, for real.
as in, gaming, my lord?
and whats the deal?
this windy tempest, ‘til it bursts into rain, kept its tears locked to turn up the drama.
yo, with all due respect, the french you speak is way better than the english im droppin.
cry, trojans, cry.
quit peeping and stop mocking with those twinkling, snoozing eyes.
dudes got a killer arm!
if youre him, sir, i need some real talk with you.
you lazy dreamer, whyd you do that?
for real, heaven forbid!
but im counting on you not to tie the knot with her.
oh, deadly sin, oh, savage ungratefulness!
cut his life bond, dear god, so i can live to say the fool is dead.
what did popilius lena say?
im stoked i found this napkin; its her first keepsake from the moor.
for the formin, theres always some form.
can i be bold enough to say i feel these spirits?
and since im a straight-up puck, if we get lucky dodging the serpents spit, well make things right soon; otherwise, call me a liar.
cousin, throw up your wager; you ready to kick it off?
come, brother john, you bravely pulled out your first sword.
i am.
get up, im gonna grab him some linen right away.
let me peep the latest news.
i wish i could end it first!
those are the words of his bad, corrupt, chunky, and rude self—not for the dames honor, man.
yo, gentle peeps, stacking our truth with all this clownin and brawls, while losing our own cred, will never score us a real friend.
villains, drop the body or, by saint paul, ill turn that disobedient punk into a corpse!
and spout bogus talk with your own shadow?
take me to my room.
if youre hurting, boss, this knave would be super pissed.
ive caught plenty of flak—not just a few—when i pushed you during your low phase and epic debt spill.
tell him he gotta wake up, and fast.
her eyes, all pleading for pity, are stuck on the ruthless lines on his face.
yo, youre one of us so we gotta roll like this or else no ones gonna have your back.
yo silius, silius, i done my part.
this vibe kinda sets up the whole plays story.
if warwick was our rock, then what?
so lucrece got busy—her sad stories spill deep feels, borrowing her vibe for that extra punch.
soldiers, peace out!
is she really gonna get a christian send-off when shes out here chasing her own salvation?
then lets roll, fam!
youre easier to swallow than a flap-dragon.
if you got any tunes that havent been heard, toot em out again.
his worries are done.
he aint got that.
please, look at me.
and i heard his highness caught that crude stroke.
boot, boot, master shallow.
he said hed link up two hours ago, and he never misses his word.
so, caesar gonna talk?
then chill and listen to my impatient vibes.
you heard her say it herself—it wasnt me.
whats up, captain macmorris!
god bless you and all the good peeps in court!
send her straight to the clink.
my dignity was supposed to last until it got exposed!
oh love spirit, youre so quick and fresh that even when you hold a seas worth, nothing really sticks—it drops in value in a minute.
i see your age and drama got you all in love.
what, you gonna disrespect me right to my face even though youre not supposed to?
hail rome, killing it even in your mourning fits!
you think im some executioner?
wheres that at?
hey, whats your name, dude?
your moms from my time.
i got you, my lord.
okay, so you got a chill dad, kid; he pulled a surprise day of joy to lift your mood, one you totally didnt see coming.
my lord protector, if youre down, here are the peace terms between our top dog and french king charles, set for eighteen months by mutual vibes.
those terms were mad hard to figure out ‘cause she aint down for any offers—not even from the dukes.
the whole shebang of our game is a seriously deep flex.
that was sickly written.
i was stuck in the mess.
so get ready, im sending out your commission right now, and hes heading to england with you.
oh dear phoebe, if you ever catch a fresh vibe on your face, youll feel the invisible scars that loves arrows leave.
oh, ive been way too slack on this!
what we got here?
spit it out, spit it out, spit it out.
is it any good, den?
then get ready for my savage wit.
so, since things are like this right now, i think you should link up with the county.
its all my lords.
hurry up, good nurse!
sir, weve rolled together in orleans.
alright, go get ready.
ill add thelenvoi.
bigger than big!
im shook to see you.
later, good launcelet.
you handled that request custom-style.
all these scholars, lawyers, courtiers, and gentlemen—theyre dubbed fake caterpillars and are basically done for.
no need for a ghost, my lord, to pop outta the grave to drop that news.
hes scared of me, and im lowkey scared of him too.
nah, you gotta drop that prized cheek display—even though damn, that hearts even harder.
the guy is, for real, enough.
what are we supposed to make of this?
i aint tryna get isbel ever since i was at court.
most beloved!
look, hes moving—step back for a bit, hell bounce back soon.
and what joy does she get from staring at the devil?
they searched everywhere—among the dead and the living—and couldnt find a trace of him.
bosko chimurcho.
didnt you tell me that fat dude was dead?
it goes straight to my brain, drying up all the dumb, gross vibes around it—it gets me alert, quick, forgetful, and fills me with snappy, fiery, dope imagery that turns into killer wit when i speak.
i can see these cardinals messing with me.
now, with this glow, if i got another shot, madam, i wouldnt want a better dad.
whos calling?
he bounces off the ground like his insides are hairs; le cheval volant, the pegasus, with fiery nostrils!
dont worry about my part in the convo.
dont bring up religion ‘cause you love the flesh and barely hit church unless youre praying against your enemies.
oh, im done for!
with their heavy, gross breaths, well get all fogged up and forced to gulp their stale air.
whats that, ducdame?
im outta here.
daylight and champagne dont reveal anything more!
i wish god would serve the world all year round!
i know you by how you wiggle your head.
even though im crazy, i wont snap at him.
for me, noble lords, i dont care which—somerset or york, theyre all the same.
oh, what a scandal it is for our crown that two noble peers like you would clash!
rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of kent destined for the gallows, drop your weapons; head back to your cribs and ditch this groom.
yeah, my lord, a son who totally earns the respect from a dad like that.
i put it out on the down low that if he shows up around now, acting all usual, hell find his crew with rides and homies ready to break him out.
i dont really get that.
come on, lets roll in and vibe with lord timons bounty.
the gods are straight-up powerful.
samson got all tempted, even though he was super strong; solomon got seduced, even though he was mad smart.
this is my hustle era.
but its clear that being humble is like the ladder of young ambition—where you look up while climbing; but once you hit the top, you turn your back on that ladder and look down, scorning the steps you climbed.
whats up, my son?
a chill vibe in a dark beauty.
youre as far from good as the other side is from us, like south is to north.
dont wander off; my loves locked down in a bond that everyone knows about.
imma vibe like the sun, letting nasty clouds hide my glow so when i pop back, everyones shook by my comeback.
a green box moment.
lowkey id rather you miss out than me, my lord; id rather her rep stay 100 than you be suspicious, no cap.
yo my lord and bro, god bless ya!
yep, thats him.
nah, neither.
treat me right and ill pay up.
wishing you good vibes and your hearts desires, your grace.
catch you in the valleys.
has any girl ever been won over like this?
you gotta bounce.
same here, like a rich guy who only checks his treasure once in a while so it stays special.
bro, you know im hella brave like hercules, but trust your gut.
cousin, dont be bummed.
no cap, im not sticking around one more sec.
i told you, my lord, if you knew where i came from, you wouldnt mess with me.
i aint throwing shade at them.
lets roll and harvest our fields before we gotta sow again.
this ragged sheet looks like a busted map.
watch how hes acting.
my boss will slide through before morning.
i checked around and got the scoop from folks who swung swords with you.
alright, cool; once hes gone, im free again.
im bugging you hard, but youre down to help.
if she turns out shady, ill keep my stables at home and roll with her in pairs; then when i see the real her, i wont trust her anymore.
you see in me a fire so bright that it burns out on the ashes of youth, like a dying ember.
honestly, my lord, i was just playing by the rules.
well smack em down so hard theyll be stuck in their seats.
there was this dude—nah, come sit and let me spill.
how you tilling soil at warp speed like that?
if its cool, maam, send your crew away and ill bring out emilia.
our fleets ready, our power assembled, our backups set, everythings locked in to our plan.
no clue.
you aint scamming more cash from me this time.
thanks, sir; right back atcha.
cmon, bro, youre too fresh for this game.
seriously, the only cure is to get the pox.
bounce.
why me, timon?
right now, lets go!
big ups to the stars, im stoked.
let our leader act like he forgot him, and all the princes ignore him.
hes rocking yellow socks.
i admit hes a jerk, but dude deserves some respect when his homies vouch for him.
youve hit her up a ton, and she, busy or lowkey avoiding it, hasnt replied—maybe shes hiding her feelings.
so since youre highborn, tell me where to get a ladder like that.
honestly, sir, shes so made up youd never rate her looks.
hes scraping the plate, bro!
theyre here and ready to make it happen.
long story short, bringing this to pentapolis blew minds all around, and everyones cheering our heir as king!
hes all caught up thinking about her dad.
knocked out at first blow—no need for a second.
so todays the final showdown; if his sword holds, im ending him.
host pistol, you gotta roll to my boss, and you, hostess too.
ive worked for him since birth, and all i got were beatings.
you just came off the bridge?
hes my kid, yeah, and thats my shame; but he didnt get that deceit from me.
swords out, and if you kill me, the gods and i forgive you.
hells not cutting anyone slack.
theres barely enough truth left to trust, but enough lies to wreck friendships.
showing up for some vinegar, telling us about prawns, then you wanted to snack even though theyre bad for fresh wounds?
i was pointed this way.
thats it?
yeah, and shell get the best of it—and props to whoever nails it.
why you acting so distant?
you know how valentines been riding with the emperor, right?
lovebirds vibe hard in spring.
wheres the list?
maam, stay optimistic; hes talking happy vibes.
hectors blowing his horn.
why you collapsing, lords?
yeah, gotta cough up cash for a wig and fix someone elses hair loss.
fishing for trout in some weird stream.
but if you bail, no more chit-chat, you gotta dip immediately.
no loyal subjects ever been more hyped to dodge a doomed mission than i am right now.
you close by?
what even is love?
jerk, your dad was a plasterer and you were a cloth-cutter, right?
thats a question to drop.
whats going on here?
alright, scram.
stay tight.
your daytime win at shrewsbury kinda overshadows your night stunt on gads hill.
grammar lesson: articles come from pronouns and decline like this: singular, nominative, hic, haec, hoc.
peace out, sir.
sneaking in straight is a killer move.
you overshot.
once i had him tied up and sent home, then i went to fix the mess he made.
ill forget standing there and remember how much i love your company.
my lord, he just dipped—he was vibing here, jamming to a song.
am i boring yall?
ill hit them up.
my lord, the london mayors here to say hey.
heads up, its gonna pour tonight.
as she bolts, the bushes grab her neck, some kiss her face, some wrap around her thigh trying to hold her, but she breaks free like a doe racing to feed her fawn.
we appreciate the offer.
sir, can i get a sec?
show your receipts.
what disrespect is this to the prince, your kid?
no way, right?
nah, she aint my vibe.
she talks, and its so real that it hits different in my brain.
go off, bacons, go off!
roll out and chop down those overgrown branches that are flexing too hard in our hood.
no cap, this crowded citys gonna spawn a ton of brainiacs.
stay hype, stay hype.
help me out, sis; this moves so righteous even all the queens will back us.
wish, my liege, youd just judged it quietly instead of making a big deal.
let him roll up.
if the english had any clue whats up, theyd dip.
nah, the bold lies; my reps getting dragged.
ill give him props for what hes won, but in armenia and his other wins, i want the same flex.
where your boss at?
no chance, valentine, if silvia ghosted me.
hang that clown, hes surviving on stale prunes and old pastries.
dont spare that kid, whose cute grin has everyones pity; treat him like the jerk the oracle said you gotta off, and chop him up with zero remorse.
first ask him how many horses the dukes squad has.
they keep growing too.
can a weak, empty jar hold that massive barrel?
if we live so quietly, getting bored by just a bit of red, bye bye nobility.
so saddle up; dont drag goodbyes, just bounce.
ugh, damn the hand that poked these holes, damn the heart that let it happen, damn the blood that spilled.
chill, bro!
hey dude, whats your take on this?
fairies be vibin.
welcome, dig in.
and tbh, i dont even care.
tell me, sadly, who youre crushing on?
him; i got him.
you ever been to court, shepherd?
yeah, when?
richard of york, hows our bro doing?
hes flexing hector of troy; the farmhands pompey the great; the priests alexander; armados pages hercules; the teachers judas maccabaeus.
theyre craving their porridge and fat beef.
yo, whats poppin, my lords!
or whos that broke dude claiming his courage didnt come from me, thinking im talking about him? his dumb flex matches my savage words.
cuz, bounce to england!
whos brave enough to call retreat or talk when i ordered ‘em to kill?
why you showing up with this wild confidence in front of my lady?
getting defied like this, i gotta thank you on my own behalf.
and he had a cousin just as fine, but in my heart was palamon, and man, what drama hes stirring!
so stop the sad vibes, let ‘em be, and be happy and cute, turning all your moans into hey nonny nonny.
bring it to the porpentine, thats where the crib is.
drifting in my crazy conscience, i steered toward this fix, and now here we are.
my hearts about to burst from impatience.
for real, i swear, its better to be born humble and chill with simple peeps than flex in shiny pain with golden grief.
whats up, sir?
sweet bassanio, my ships sank, creditors are savage, my estates tanking, my loan to the jews defaulted, and paying it means id die, so were even if i could just see you when i die.
ive been worth the hype.
handle the path, and itll do the job.
for real, hes the worlds biggest coward jack-priest.
so im leaving you in the rich gods care, like thieves to guards.
hows my kate doing?
grab your lute, girl.
super productive.
he knows the game; he really rides the breeze!
yeah for sure, bro.
nah, thatd be a shame.
if you bounce, the dauphins squads all set to trap you.
well see how you handle it.
ugh, damn!
aufidius and volscians, listen up, we wont get any news from rome in secret.
his plans to bring this greek to calchass crib and hand him over for freed antenor, the fair cressid.
good cromwell, dont sleep on him; use this chance and secure your future.
were leaving his sad queen in ephesus as a servant to diana.
why bail, i ask you?
my lord, i cant spill state secrets, im just an outsider that council motions cant move; so i cant share my thoughts since i keep getting it wrong.
well make our rose carpets and a thousand sweet posies there.
id be down, sir, but that fool should hang with your boss as much as my lady.
and the blood we wanna spill is mutual, yours in me and mine in you.
i wish i did; then id have smashed your head and begged you for mercy.
this sleeps legit; its the kind thats knocked out so many english kings from their golden thrones.
and if you crown him, ill call it: english blood will fertilize the soil and future generations will curse this dirty move.
im no slut, im as honest as you but youre trashing me.
hang that baboon!
then, englands courier, hurry back and tell fake edward, your so-called king, that lewis of france is sending partygoers to rage with him and his new bride.
i see you for real, youre too cocky; but even if you were the devil, youd still look good.
nope, no ones stepping foot in my crib.
my general doesnt give a damn about you.
theyll get wars and foot the bill for their arrogance.
woo, woo!
whats that supposed to mean?
porters dude.
plantagenet is ditching plantagenet; edward pays edwards dying debt.
but caesars still marching on; these prophecies apply to everyone, including caesar.
marrying hims a dead end; being his sluts straight-up dumb.
you take the lute, and you grab the books; youre heading to see your students now.
yo peter, you totally nailed it!
evening, varro.
this chatter wont bug me anymore.
for a sec, but hey!
not dark in my head, though my legs are shook.
and same here, because in his grave, trust me, my loves laid to rest.
edward, how you gonna make it up for raising an army, hyping up my people, and all the chaos you caused me?
if real lovers ever clash, its written in destiny.
either here or at the capitol.
come on, lets bounce.
no more, cuz.
youre shaking, and your pale cheek spills the tea more than your words.
and now this pale swan in her watery nest starts the sad song of her inevitable end: she said a few words are all that fit the crime, since no excuse can fix it.
when something that massive snaps, it makes an even louder bang.
they were hyped to think i was on pompeys level.
the basic crowd just calls it three.
a fragile flex is shining on that face.
and its just… is?
i know exactly where that spot is.
wisdom sees that people who dont even blush for their darkest deeds wont learn to step into the light.
real talk, youre cursed by both your dad and mom; dodging your fathers drama only throws you into your mothers mess.
ive totally lost all hope.
my lord, theyre waiting for you to hand your daughter off to her hubby.
dont mistreat me.
and just like that, the lion dipped.
brutus, dont mess with me, im not having it.
dead silent?
whos rolling up?
the english squads camp at agincourt.
trust me, sir, shes the hottest chick alive—when the crowd saw her, they made more noise than a ship caught in a savage storm.
then collatine couldve chilled next to lucrece and stayed snoozing in peace.
who you wanna ride for?
her husband, dude!
so bounce, and leave her in style.
but you aint quick to throw down.
yo, wild one, whats up?
what am i supposed to think?
every heartbreak spawns a new heir, and right now some neighbor is tryna cash in on our misery and beat us down, conquering poor me when im already down.
the letters already slit her throat.
the thane of cawdors alive, living large; and thinking ill be king? thats as wild as being cawdor.
ive picked up every disease under her roof—hows that even possible?
does he know about this?
he sent word, sir… here he is.
then leave them be until they sober up; if they still cant talk sense, tell them theyre not who you thought.
i came to spill the tea; long story short, shes been talking too much—turns out the ladys a snake.
keep going, sir; i can handle your worst clapbacks.
im a tyrian gent named pericles, schooled in arts and arms; hunting for adventures, got wrecked at sea, and washed up on your shore.
acordo linta.
so, sir, im testing my luck here—either my prayers hit or they flop forever; pause this drama, hang your shield over your heart, around the neck that pays me, and ill serve these poor queens for free.
my ladys a cataian, were politicos, malvolios a jester, and were three merry dudes.
nighty night, yall.
sir john falstaff, need a word.
what sneaky dudes creeping over there?
well, later, portia.
what a shady sidekick this is!
its gotta be you—you straight-up offed him.
shame on you, lord winchester, chill out!
so what masks and dances we throwing to kill the three-hour gap between dinner and bedtime?
sextus pompeius just threw down the gauntlet to caesar and runs the sea empire now.
accept my hustle, and long live your lordship.
i wasnt calling for you.
go do your sewing; stop meddling with her.
in front of agamemnons tent.
i thought i was… no one can even explain it.
heres a prophet i grabbed from pomfrets streets—he was mobbed by hundreds; he rapped that by next ascension-day, youll have to hand over your crown.
damn, what an embarrassment!
im scared helens life was snatched dirty.
youll want me gone faster; youll prove fake if you force me to stay.
my lord, if tamora ever looked good to you, listen to me for everyone; and sweetie, forgive whats done.
here, take this mood letter.
the real homie i bless is still in tarsus, where everyone thinks his words are gospel and even builds statues of himself; but your eyes got the real tea—why say more?
these beetle-brows are gonna be red for me.
whats all this, lord antonio?
barely had the sun dried the morning dew when cytherea, heartbroken, waited for adonis under a brookside bush, the same stream adon chilled in.
hows it hanging, your grace?
they say, for your royal self, if you plan to sleep and forbid any wake-up calls under penalty of death, but if a snake slithers up with its forked tongue, you gotta wake up so that worm doesnt kill you forever.
and why am i whining about this perk?
yeah but, i gotta admit, my hearts feeling empty.
you hit the nail on the head about him.
he says shes a freak, shames her, and then kills her with a kiss.
hey you, move over.
new trends, no matter how dumb or unmanly, still get followed.
my knight, ill fire up your passion and make you go wild.
shell hate that romeo missed all this, but ill write mantua again and keep her locked up till romeo shows.
i bet you can.
ill take it, sir.
lord angelos realizing hes safe; i see a spark in his eye.
nothing else.
one of your lordships pages.
but seriously, youre not actually insane, are you?
hurry up, so i can rest my head in your lap.
down to the last syllable.
let him in, sir.
take her away; her hearts overloaded; shell bounce back.
from now on, timons squad and all humans can hate me!
youre so broke and miserable, youre scared to die?
cant lord stanley catch some zs these endless nights?
but their vibes sweetened by the hope of what they have, and hopes almost as lit as actually living the dream.
this is legit fidele.
hold up, heres forty ducats.
if youre cool with this and trust its your lucky break, go to your girl and seal it with a kiss.
is she really as wild as the rumors say?
help, peeps downstairs!
im not gonna be a soft, dumb fool nodding, sighing, and giving in to christian pity.
oh, brief mercy of mortals, we chase it harder than gods grace!
haha!
but since i cant, just know im staying neutral.
yeah, thats my stance.
youre one of the fakes.
thats exactly how we split them.
witch take me if i meant it like that!
shame on you, generals!
after all that, im just gonna lay low around here.
imagine the ship is the stage, and sea-sick pericles is about to speak.
its crazy to think unpolished commoners could send that message to their ruler.
if youre down, ill bring you to him on deck, let you meet him, whisper your asks; and if anyone but the king can get it done, im your man.
yo, whats good!
why those horns youre so proud to owe to your wives.
come at me and do your best to spook me with your ghosts; youre hella good at it.
and the kid i gave to falstaff.
ill run, fiend, my heels obey you, ill run.
here, my lord.
pry it open; easy does it!
neither time nor place stuck back then, yet you tried to force both; they made themselves, and now their vibe unfits you.
youve, by luck and the kings favors, skipped the low-key steps and now youre up top with power at your side, and your words, your servants, do whatever you want.
you were like fresh flowers, now totally wilted.
not at all, for real.
but shes obsessed with that token, ‘cause he made her promise to always keep it, so she keeps it close to kiss and chat with.
oh hidden joke, inscrutable and invisible, like a nose on a face or a weather vane on a steeple!
didnt she promise to make it up to you?
me, who never cried, now melting with sorrow that winter cut short our spring.
ive been the book of his good deeds, where everyone read his fame, blown up bigger than ever; ive always vouched for my friends, and hes top dog, no cap.
lawyers chill in between sessions; they snooze term to term and dont notice time flying.
now that ive got the kid, ill fix that annoying flaw in her eyes.
shady words go in one stupid ear and do nothing.
a messenger from the galleys.
small dogs arent noticed when they bark, but big guys freeze when the lion roars; and humphrey is no small dude in england.
unlivable and almost unreachable, yet he still made it.
we could be chilling there, ruling over france and its almost-royal dukedoms, or lay these bones in a sad, forgotten tomb.
ever see a book with nasty content so nicely wrapped?
but whos pulling up here?
peep how his goodness, like a hidden sun, breaks through his basic outfit.
the towns begging, the trumpets calling us to fight, and we just talk and, for real, do nothing.
where are these lazy door guys?
im not reading your bosss lines.
your boy tranio saved me by swapping clothes and faces, and i, to escape, put on his gear; since landing, i killed a dude and im scared i got spotted.
the fox stays quiet when hes about to snatch the lamb.
so coriolanus shows he knows theyll love or hate him and, chill as ever, just lets them see it.
yep, my liege, and hes a handsome kid.
perfect timing, here comes the duke himself.
peace out, i mean it.
they say shes gone mad.
this advice of yours is full of wise caution, maam.
yep, bro, were all sad about it.
i see their scam.
my oberon, what wild visions ive had!
then, by god, its the gods biggest injustice.
ive got a cute story to tell you.
where was i?
call my servant; ill suit up again.
some guys are into my lady, some are into joan.
shes neither fish nor flesh; no one knows what to make of her.
im just hanging around here.
calm down, angry stars of heaven!
remember i told you last night: theres a rich franklin in kent with three hundred marks in gold.
dont be shocked or wonder why i call you that; i wont explain it.
im tired, give me a break; dang, my bones ache!
i beg you, sweet york, who told you that?
a joyless, gloomy, black, and sorrowful outcome.
its as easy as playing a flute: pinch the holes, blow, and youll get fire music.
who even knows that lodowick?
i wont bail, if i live.
later, monsieur; ive spoken better of you than you deserve, but we gotta fight evil with good.
by day, she said, nights are wide open, and my true eyes never learned to hide wrongs behind a fake look.
they were too rough tossing her in the sea.
my friends, you wanna come closer?
and i pick clarence as protector.
my lords, lets make peace.
hey, dont be mad, sir.
the king just dropped his guard.
my tongues spilling slander in every language, stuffing ears with lies.
isnt that a badass?
im tied to the stake, gotta ride this out.
wounded to the bone.
my widows comfort and my sorrows cure!
whats up, gertrude?
i swear, before these eyes sleep, ill serve hard or lie in the ground for it; or die trying, and ill paint as bravely as i can, thats the gist.
i swear by my meals, i met a fool who laid in the sun and ranted at lady luck in perfect terms, still a total clown.
whys my lord doing that?
nah, they wont see our horses; ill tie them in the woods; well switch masks after; and hey, ive got buckram suits ready to hide our usual gear.
oh, your lieutenant, cassio.
nope, youre not leaving tonight.
or who gave it to you?
sweet blowse, youre a real beauty.
if we werent standing up against them all, theyd have squared off already, theyve got enough reason to draw swords.
if youre cool with this, ill be both judge and jury, youre that merciful.
for joves sake and your clear virginity, stand up for us and our struggles.
nah, im not feeling it: old school rules are best; im not picky enough to swap real rules for random ideas.
no horses: i see you wanna be in that fight.
its just the transcript of our chat.
im as sharp in my head, fool, as you are.
right now id trade a thousand miles of sea for a patch of empty land.
ive got zero time to waste or favors to do till you ask.
sons, kin, thanes, and you nearest, know well set our estate on malcolm, our eldest; we call him prince of cumberland, and that honor comes with stars shining on all worthy.
wheres a woman so perfect whose bare womb refuses her husbands care?
your reasons.
oh noble emperor, dont fight at sea.
but lie down, ho!
is man so hated by you, though youre a man yourself?
surprised, my lord?
that rebellion got bad luck?
im judas, shame on you, judas.
never heard or even suspected.
your honour is hella welcome.
ride them out and slash their hides so their hot blood splashes in english eyes, hyping them up with extra courage, ha!
im not about chasing what everyone craves, i refuse to ride the basic crowd wave.
one kiss shuts us up and we part silent; thats me giving mine and stealing your heart.
for you, ill go against myself and argue, ‘cause i could never love the one you hate.
everyones tearing him apart!
no matter how god or fate dealt my hand, i live or die loyal to king richards throne, a true, just, and stand-up guy.
im pericles of tyre: but tell me my drowned queens name, ‘cause you said you were flawless, heir to kingdoms and a new life for pericles your dad.
trust me, theyre legit princes.
if lusty love went hunting beauty, where would it be prettier than in blanche?
caesar, watch out for brutus; beware cassius; steer clear of casca; keep an eye on cinna; dont trust trebonius; peep metellus cimber; decius brutus isnt your fan; you wronged caius ligarius.
i dont even know love, he said, and i wont know it unless its a wild boar i can chase; borrowing is too much and i refuse to owe; loving love is cool, but it drags it down; i heard its like living death, laughing and crying in a breath.
the sons of york, better born than you, will bail their dads out; and those who doubt the boys can eat their words!
he only dealt in lieutenancy and never had real war zone cred.
thats it: my moms son got your dads heir; your dads heir has to get your dads land.
we prescribe this, even though were no docs; deep hate cuts way too deep.
whose old lady is that?
my lord, im lowkey worried you forgot britain.
get the barge ready and deck it out to match his vibe.
lord angelos a hardass.
im all about your smart move there.
this is what helps me hold back my rage and handle my bad luck with chill tears and suppressed sighs, so i dont wreck king edwards legacy, the real heir to the english crown.
cromwell, i never thought id cry in my worst days, but you forced me, with your honest truth, to get all emotional.
down to the last penny; its the kings.
god bless you to his grace—you were the cutest babe i ever raised, and if i live to see you wed, ill be set.
but honestly, i cant do much harm to you.
dont you have any sense of place, people, or timing?
ive got sixty ships; caesars got nothing better.
proteus is rolling with them.
oh, help me, help me!
real talk, she gasped ‘father once or twice like it crushed her heart, crying ‘sisters, sisters!
like bees driven off by smoke and doves by a stench, theyre all forced from their homes.
youre there followed by a loyal shepherd.
if quick thought doesnt crack it, an even quicker move will, but i feel thought might slip.
your royal sorrow shows so hard ill wear it in my heart.
alright, ill go see her.
ill keep this lesson on lock as a guard for my heart.
weve made a deal.
cytherea, you rock that bed so well!
god, i hope its real, sir.
its like having selective deafness.
whos blocking me on my mission?
the king just got word, macbeth, about your win, and reading about your solo fight in the rebels battle, he cant decide whether to praise you or himself; then he sees you in norways ranks, fearless of the death you caused.
how you doing, your grace?
you make a wish and id dive into the sea, where constant stress trades places with a minute of peace.
whats up with this switch-up?
the wrongs i did you hit me fresh now, and your rare kindnesses speak louder than my past slackness!
do you even know me, buddy?
and uncle worcester, damn it!
youre killing me by denying it.
what flag?
oh, thats the guy who blew kisses like a polite king.
when your carts stacked with heads, ill hop off and run by the wheel like your low-key servant all day, from hyperions rise to his fall in the sea.
and it still cant catch up to your slow cash flow.
lets bounce.
please, father, if youre weak, look it.
these three world-sharers, these rivals, are on your ship.
oh, shame on them!
publius, whats good?
lions can tame leopards.
not me.
so what?
as soon as you can, since you gotta pull the opposite way.
and now who knows but you, lorenzo, if im yours?
now were close enough.
the queens coming.
gloucester, i live to thank you for your love to the king and avenge my honor.
i put on julius caesar myself.
its not right for you to stand while lewis sits, given your rank.
hes my lord; the one i serve above him is my master.
you think, hortensio, that any dude is dumb enough to marry hell even if her dads loaded?
you crazy woman, you gonna hide this shady plot?
i beg you, send my old reply back: have them fulfill it and then sell my bones.
but, master, ill go set up the net.
whats that?
nothing but dirty stuff!
snake fillet in the cauldron boil and bake; eye of newt and frogs toe; bat fur and dogs tongue; adders fork and blindworms sting; lizards leg and owls wing, for a powerful trouble brew, like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
you gotta train to fight without achilles.
lets do it, good sir.
oppressed nature is sleeping.
yep, thats the point: but without him wed look weak; we shouldnt go too far till we get his help; in such a bloody situation, guesses and hopes arent enough.
sometimes her eyes level out like theyre aiming for the stars; sometimes they drop to earth; sometimes they stare straight; then they scatter everywhere, leaving her mind and sight all mixed up.
good heart, whats up?
bardolph, sir john, theres a brook down there who really wants to talk to you and sent you a morning drink.
whats up, sir john?
is it heading toward polands coast, sir, or some border?
if knowing is the goal, knowing you is enough; that tongues smart if it can praise you, and that souls dumb that sees you without awe; its a compliment i admire your skills.
if she asks again, do anything.
follow me, peace crew, follow, follow, follow.
my letter will clear up my feelings for him.
find him and bring him here.
oh, thats wild!
whats gonna happen to the duke of somerset?
one drop of blood from your homeland should hurt more than rivers of foreign gore.
for so many of our princes—damn, the pain!
in the divorce, his opposite moves are all laid out, showing him as id want my enemy to be.
eighty-eight hours, and hours away from lovers feel more boring than a clocks eighty repeats?
oh, thats a nasty, bold conspiracy!
give me your hand: sorry i hit you; but as long as you live, keep your mouth in check.
signior arm arm sends his respects.
i felt that heavy vibe dragging me down.
what time tomorrow should i roll up to your place?
you were gaming at five or seven?
hed be so hyped if you used his luck as your backup.
hey dad, let her know that she and aunt percy will follow your lead ASAP.
this ghost is legit torturing me, oh!
so poor suffolks been exiled ten times—once by the king and three times by you.
ugh, i could literally sob with my eyes and flex with my words!
im begging you, lets get back to the real talk.
go back and get beaten up again?
wait, my boss as the writer wrote the letter to himself?
yo squad, lets stick together.
you caught me at the perfect moment—I was about to confess i loved you.
yo, whats the problem?
you get nothing from saying nothing—say something.
why are you even talking to me?
pillicock chilled on pillicock hill, alow alow loo loo!
baptista, gremio, and tranio just walked back in.
dang, you really buried in that book?
religion keeps promises, but you swear against it by swearing on the very thing youre denying, using an oath to back an oath.
yo, apemantus?
cesario, youre not holding up your end.
please, lets bounce.
if i kick it before you, wrap me in one of those sheets, please.
and isnt the tavern hostess a total sweetheart?
something about him clicks with that vibe when he says good morning so hype.
some jerk just messed me over.
alright, lords of salisbury and warwick, dinners done—let me get your take on my claim to englands throne, because its legit.
thats just nitpicking; hes old, im young.
whats up with our cousin now?
let me be anointed with deadly venom and die before anyone can say ‘god save the queen.
get up, grumio—lets squash this beef.
if youre gentlemen, do me this solid and hear me out.
no one else but you, and tonight well roam the streets solo and peep peoples vibes.
feed them compliments and make them soft: one silent good deed slays a thousand waiting for it.
accidentally i had my bosss fake letter telling him to find her near milford; so he ran off in my clothes, all wild, swearing to mess with my ladys honor.
thanks, my lord.
im happy about that.
but not everyone can chill like you, lord.
he shut down our messengers; so we packed up and went to see him.
glad you say that, but were just the dukes lowkey officers; honestly, if i were as chill as a king, id give you all ive got.
alright, hes there too, plus mordake and a thousand blue-caps.
attendants with aaron just walked back in.
but he loses it in a weird kind of high spirits.
but heres thurio.
you saw what happened; now go face your king.
ill roast you with savage wit and then whip out my dagger.
yeah, i can barely hang around; but i hate drifting into dreams, so ill stick around despite everything.
fresh lily, and whiter than fresh sheets!
look alive, menenius.
dont even worry about that.
be brave, your captains brave and promises change.
if hes caught benedick, its gonna cost him a grand to fix it.
those who call you hobgoblin and sweet puck, you do their bidding and theyll have good luck.
for real, you did; my bones can vouch for feeling his wraths full force.
thats a plan.
where can i catch you?
its gone and wont reply.
compassions asleep.
as for those we set free, we want one of them to bounce.
i hope to hit up london at least once before i die.
theyll blame us, saying we shouldve kept this wild kid locked up.
whats your name?
youre slandering goodness by roasting me.
edmund, i heard you treated your dad like a kid.
well then, im onto you.
nah.
leave me alone.
hate the crime, not the person?
but what about that bloody napkin?
ugh, de la pole, dont mute yourself; youve got a voice, right?
its noted: whoever the king likes, the cardinal will hook up with a job—and keep them far from court.
rebellious head, dont lift until birnam wood moves, and macbeth will live out his days, paying his dues to time and fate.
rouens in mourning ‘cause that brave crew dipped.
theres something dark in his soul thats got him stuck, and i bet if we spill it, trouble follows. to stop that, ive decided: hes going to england ASAP to ask for the tribute we owe. maybe new seas and lands will shake that stuck thought from his mind.
im nothing worth praising god for, and you should know that!
she definitely wasnt.
nah, i swear, youre worth a penny, a horse, and a man is more than one, but still not a ton.
a bit of water washes this off: how simple is that!
make sure he hears it; otherwise he might think were too scared to question our spot or clueless about who we are.
im not about that flex life.
scram!
couldnt be happier, sir.
love that you can count on is broke.
didnt you chip in?
what a sneaky jerk!
its you and your crew who dissed me.
and did he beg for forgiveness?
no need for an epilogue, please; your shows already solid.
falstaff, good night.
she says you plan to turn her into your puppet.
his heads been chopped off and shipped to angelo.
add me to your good list.
ugh, get him outta here!
from everything ive read or heard, true loves path is never easy.
his new bride wont save him; and clarence, my letters say, might ditch him soon for chasing lust over honor or whats best for our country.
leave her be.
so in all your letters to rome or foreign rulers, you signed ‘ego et rex meus, basically making the king your servant.
i swear, my lord, ill handle it; now god bless you with a peaceful night.
now, noble charmian, lets get this done; once youre finished, youre free to chill forever.
