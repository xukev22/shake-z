when you're older, wrinkles gonna hit you tough, that glow-up won't stay; beauty fades, that's rough. when asked, "where'd your looks go?" what'll you say? "in my sunken selfies," nah, that's just cringe, ay. but if you say, "here's my kid, they got my glow," that flex eternalnow that's a w, bro.
check the mirrorsee that face? its prime time to pass on your grace. if you dont, you're lowkey robbing the earth, stealing someone's chance to flex that birth. you reflect your moms og glow, keep the cycle going, dont end the show. if you stay solo and ghost this game, your fire dies with youthats just lame.
